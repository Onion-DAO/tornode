# Text instructions

1. Any modern CPU
1. 1.5 GB RAM
1. 256MB disk space available for Tor

For details see [the official documentation]( https://community.torproject.org/relay/relays-requirements/ ).

## Setup steps

In order to qualify for an Onion POAP, you need to run a Tor exit node. Ideally, you do so at a datacenter. We're going to assume you are using a VPS (virtual private server) with Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`.

### Step 1: purchase a VPS

Not all VPS providers like it if you run a Tor exit node.

- OnionDAO keeps a [crowdsourced list of suitable providers here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ztkonpfs0u3NP1HA-V6rhE6eK77W6y0Q8gG_yv9tI3s)
- The Tor community keeps a [ list of exit node friendly providers here ]( https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/good-bad-isps/ )
- A crypto community member hosts a list of [ those accepting Bitcoin here ]( https://torbitcoinvps.github.io/ )

Most VPS providers have different VPS options. Choose one that has at least 1.5GB RAM. When asked about an operating system, choose Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`.

Your provider should send you a username, password and ip address. `Ssh` into your server now.

### Step 2: run the install script

Clone this repo and run the setup script:

```
git clone https://github.com/Onion-DAO/tornode.git
cd tornode
sudo bash setup.sh
```

### Step 3: keep it running for a month

After a month, the POAPs will be distributed through poap.delivery.
